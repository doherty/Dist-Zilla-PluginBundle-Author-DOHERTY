USAGE
    Just put "[@DOHERTY]" in your dist.ini. You can supply the following
    options:

    *   "fake_release" specifies whether to use "FakeRelease" instead of
        "UploadToCPAN". Defaults to 0.

    *   "bugtracker" specifies a URL for your bug tracker. This is passed to
        "Bugtracker", so the same interpolation rules apply. Defaults to
        "http://github.com/doherty/%s/issues'".

    *   "add_tests" is a comma-separated list of testing plugins to add to
        "TestingMania".

    *   "skip_tests" is a comma-separated list of testing plugins to skip in
        "TestingMania".

    *   "tag_format" specifies how a git release tag should be named. This
        is passed to "Git::Tag".

    *   "version_regex" specifies a regexp to find the version number part
        of a git release tag. This is passed to "Git::NextVersion".
